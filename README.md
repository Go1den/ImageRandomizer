# Image Randomizer
Image Randomizer by Go1den

This program is designed to display images in a shuffled order.
Place all the images you want to shuffle in the images folder.
Each image will only be displayed once per shuffle. 

This has only been tested with .png images. Other image types might work, but are NOT guaranteed.

The window will resize to match the image, so if you want to have a consistent window size, make sure all images have the same width and height.

This program is available for free, but if you find some use out of it, I'd always appreciate a subscription at twitch.tv/go1den! Thanks!
